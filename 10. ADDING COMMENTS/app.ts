//10. ADDING COMMENTS
//Choose two of the programs you've written, and add atleast one comment to each.
//If you don't have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.


//My Name is Ekta
//Dated : 23/02/2024
//This program will run simple code 'Hello World'

console.log('Hello World simple program');  //this code does not contain any comments, because comments are always placed before writting any code.
