//35. ANIMALS
//Think of atleast three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. 
let pet_animals = ["Rabbit", "Cat", "Dog"]

//Task 1: Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as; A dog would make a great pet! 

for(let onePet of pet_animals){
    console.log(`A ${onePet} would make a great pet.`)
}

//Task 2: Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as: Any of these  animals would make a great pet!
console.log("Any of these animals would make a great pet!")
